# Time-Series

I present here the project I did, jointly with Faith Zhang, as part of the time-series course.
We worked on following questions:
  1. How did homeownership rate change across the United States?
  2. What was the impact of sub-prime crisis on homeownership rate?
  3. Fitting the best model to analyze the above questions.
  4. Can we forecast future homeownership rate?
